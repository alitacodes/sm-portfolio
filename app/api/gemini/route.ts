const snehaDescription = `I'm Sneha Mandal, a passionate and driven undergraduate student specializing in frontend development. Currently, I'm expanding my expertise into backend technologies and exploring the evolving landscape of Web3. I believe that continuous learning is the key to staying ahead in tech, and I'm committed to honing my skills across the full stack. In parallel with my development journey, I'm delving into the fascinating domain of Quantum Computingâ€”a field I believe holds the potential to unlock a new era of computation. To me, it's not just a subject of study, but a gateway to the future, a possible key to what I call the quantum world lock. Outside the realm of technology, I have a deep appreciation for physics, especially astronomy and quantum mechanics, which fuel my curiosity and inspire my thinking. When I'm not coding or reading about the cosmos, you'll find me immersed in books, playing the piano, or expressing creativity through sketching. These pursuits ground me and keep my imagination alive, adding balance to my analytical side.`
